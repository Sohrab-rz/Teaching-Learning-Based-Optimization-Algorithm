# Teaching-Learning-Based-Optimization-Algorithm
MATLAB code for Teaching Learning Based Optimization Algorithm (minimization and maximization)


How to use:


step 1 : Define your desired function below and then run the main TLBO code


step 2 : Modify Paramaters in the main file such as number of stutends, dimensions, number of iterations and etc. 


step 3 : Enjoy!
